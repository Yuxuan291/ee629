# IoT Project: decision tree model in Python


#This topic is a simple implementation of decision tree model in machine learning by the use of Python package（sklearn and graphviz）. The idea of this project is originated from the experience of modeling and simulation class in this semester. So I combine the modeling tool and Python coding of IoT context to implement this project. This is an analysis of the survivors in Titanic accident, by using the machine learning tools and appilication of decision tree model, the relationship between the probability of survivor and related factors will be obtained. And then, the validation approach will be used to optimize the result of the decision tree model, the model will be also verificated by the relative accuracy and be tested by the rest of data. 

#In order to collect the useful data, I searched online and find this source https://www.encyclopedia-titanica.org/titanic-passenger-list/. There are the information of 1350 passengers on Titanic, basing on this source, the characteristics of the victims and the survivors will be further analyzed through machine learning. 

#The detail of processes in this project is listed below:
#1.
